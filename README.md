Stephen's Dotfiles
==================

All my dotfiles in one handy repository, storing all my settings for the following tools:

 * neovim
 * tmux
 * fish
 * git

There will be some legacy dotfiles here and there, but those 3 are my day-to-day tools.

## Neovim

Using the built-in LSP Client so this needs a bit of setup to get going

### Eslint

Using [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/) rather than eslint.

```
npm install -g eslint_d
```

### Typescript

Install the Typescript LSP
```
npm install -g typescript-language-server
```
